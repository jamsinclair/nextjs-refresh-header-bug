# Next.js Bug Reproduction Template

> Provides the minimum amount of code requried for a Next.js app. This can be used as a base to clearly demonstrate and reproduce bugs and issues with Next.js.

## Usage
- [Create a respository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
- Modify base code to replicate your problem
- When replicated be sure to include a link in relevant GitHub issue or discussion.  

This repo template will likely become less relevant once https://nextjs.org/live is fully launched 😎
